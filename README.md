# FizzBuzz-App
This project is a practice on Jinja templating where I will be creating a FizzBuzz app in Flask

# Here are the requirements:
The app should have one route, /fizzbuzz, that renders an HTML template.
In the template, loop through the numbers 1 to 100 inside of an unordered list.
For every number that is divisible by 3, show a list element with the word 'Fizz'
For every number that is divisible by 5, show a list element with the word 'Buzz'
For every number that is divisible by both 3 and 5, show a list element with 'FizzBuzz'
For every other number, show a list element with the number
